# Ansible Challenge # 2

1. Create a role named "show_version"

    from mycode dir:
            mkdir -p roles/show_version/tasks

         mycode/
         |
         | --- 
         |
         | roles/
             |
             | show_version/
                    |
                    | tasks/
                        |
                        | - main.yml

2. Have the "tasks/main.yml" tasks perform the cli_command "show version"

     vim roles/show_version/tasks/main.yml
             
             - name: Show the version
               cli_command:
                 command: show version


3. Create a new playbook in the "mycode" directory called "netconfig01.yml" which 
   runs the "show_version" role against the arista_switches hosts


     vim netconfig01.yml

             ---
             - name: Use the show_version role to prove we can
               hosts: ~^arista

               roles:
               - name: show_version

If you are feeling advanced: 

Create a block and rescue section inside of the show_version role which will 
have the block fail if a condition is met (You pick what condition that is).
