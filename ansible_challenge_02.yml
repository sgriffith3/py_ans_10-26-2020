# Ansible Challenge # 2

1. Create a role named "show_version"
2. Have the "tasks/main.yml" tasks perform the cli_command "show version"
3. Create a new playbook in the "mycode" directory called "netconfig01.yml" which 
   runs the "show_version" role against the arista_switches hosts


If you are feeling advanced: 

Create a block and rescue section inside of the show_version role which will 
have the block fail if a condition is met (You pick what condition that is).
