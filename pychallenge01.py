#Python Challenge Lab # 1


#Take these 3 existing lists:

dogs = []
fish = []

pets = [{"type": "dog", "name": "mudge", "age": 4}, 
        {"type": "fish", "name": "dorothy", "age": "3 days"},
		{"type": "dog", "name": "bingo", "age": 12},
		{"type": "fish", "name": "nemo", "age": 2},
		{"type": "cat", "name": "fluffy", "age": 1}
		]
		
#Use a for loop to sort each pet dictionary from the 
#list of pets into the dogs or fish list.

#*Hint: if your iterator is "item" you will need to use item["type"] to
#       determine what type of animal it is.

#If it is not a dog or a fish, print "Not my pet"
